         commits, dev-logs, manuals, etc.) with paths or commit SHAs\n   - Open questions or \
         follow-ups\n   Keep it tight: synthesize, don't transcribe. Aim for 200-1500 words \
         depending on conversation depth.\n\
         \n\
         2. Call `KmsWrite(kms: \"{kms_name}\", page: \"{page}\", content: \"...\")` with \

         {dump_text}\n\
         === END DUMP ===\n\
         \n\
         ## Routing procedure\n\
         \n\
         1. **Scan the dump for distinct chunks.** A chunk is one coherent piece — one decision, \
         one observation, one meeting takeaway, one new source reference, one person update. \
         A single dump usually contains 1–6 chunks.\n\
         \n\
         2. **For each chunk, pick a destination:**\n\
         - `append-to-existing`: chunk extends an existing page. `KmsSearch` first to find the \
         right page, then `KmsAppend`.\n\
         - `create-new-page`: chunk is a new topic. Pick a descriptive page stem (kebab-case), \
         use `KmsWrite` with frontmatter (`category`, `created`, `updated`, optionally `tags` and \
         `sources`).\n\
         - `defer`: chunk is too ambiguous to route confidently, or would require inventing \
         sources. Skip and report.\n\
         \n\
         3. **Announce-then-execute.** BEFORE making any tool calls, print your routing plan in \
         plain text — one bullet per chunk:\n\
         - \"Append to `existing-page` — <one-line summary of what's being added>\"\n\
         - \"Create new page `new-page-stem` — <one-line summary>\"\n\
         - \"Skip <chunk topic> — <reason>\"\n\
         \n\
         The user reads this plan and can ⌃C to abort. Only after the plan, fire the tool calls.\n\
         \n\
         4. **Hard rules** (every chunk):\n\
         - Don't invent sources, URLs, file paths, or person names that aren't in the dump.\n\
         - Don't use `KmsDelete`.\n\
         - Preserve existing frontmatter on appends.\n\
         - Every new page must reference at least one existing page (markdown link \
         `[text](pages/other.md)`) — if you can't link it to anything, downgrade to `defer`.\n\
         - For `KmsWrite`, always pass `kms: \"{kms_name}\"`.\n\
         \n\
         5. **Final report.** End with a single message:\n\
         ```\n\
         **Created**: <list of new pages>\n\
         **Appended**: <list of (page, what was added)>\n\
         **Skipped**: <list of (chunk topic, reason)>\n\
         ```\n\
         \n\
         Stop after one pass. Do not loop or wait for further input."

         \n\
         1. Extract the key premises behind the position.\n\
         2. Search the vault — run `KmsSearch(kms: \"{kms_name}\", pattern: ...)` for each premise. \
         Try multiple patterns: synonyms, related concepts, names of stakeholders. Look for:\n\
         - Past failures or regrets on this topic\n\
         - Reversed decisions (where the user previously decided differently)\n\
         - Notes flagging risks about this exact approach\n\
         - Contradictions where the user held the opposite position\n\
         3. `KmsRead` every match that looks substantive — read the full page, not just the matched line.\n\
         4. Produce a structured analysis:\n\
         \n\
         **Your position:** <restate the user's claim clearly>\n\
         \n\
         **Counter-evidence from your vault:**\n\
         - <citation> (page: `<stem>`, date: <date>): <quote or paraphrase>\n\
         - ...\n\
         \n\
         **Blind spots:** what the user may be ignoring based on their own history\n\
         \n\
         **Verdict:** is this position consistent with past experience, or does the vault suggest caution?\n\
         \n\
         ## Hard rules\n\
         \n\
         - **Don't be agreeable.** The point is to pressure-test. Push back if the vault gives you ammunition.\n\
         - **Cite specific pages** with their stems so the user can re-read.\n\
         - **If you find no counter-evidence** after a thorough search, say so honestly — but search broadly first (try synonyms, alternative phrasings, related concept names).\n\
         - **Don't write to the vault.** This command is read-only. End with the analysis, no `KmsWrite` / `KmsAppend` calls.\n\
         \n\
         Stop after one pass. The analysis is your final message."
